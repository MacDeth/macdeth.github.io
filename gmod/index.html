    <h5 id="ruleset-name-rather-dog-whistle-what-s-this-see-sections-2-4-and-2-4-1-">Ruleset Name: <code style="font-family: Hack, monospace;">rather dog whistle</code> <em>(What&#39;s this? See sections 2.4 and 2.4.1)</em></h5>
    <h5 id="_all-players-and-admins-are-responsible-for-knowing-these-rules-before-playing-on-the-server_"><em>ALL PLAYERS AND ADMINS ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR KNOWING THESE RULES BEFORE PLAYING ON THE SERVER</em></h5>
    <ol>
    <li><em>Instantly bannable offenses:</em><ol>
    <li>Blocking the spawn area.</li>
    <li>Spamming props.</li>
    <li>Spamming the toolgun.</li>
    <li>Mass RDM.<ol>
    <li>RDM, or &quot;Random Death Matching&quot;, is killing another player without a legitimate roleplay reason. Legitimate roleplay reasons do NOT include those massively disruptive to normal gameplay (&quot;genocide&quot; and other such reasons).</li>
    </ol>
    </li>
    <li>Threats to DDoS, DoS, or otherwise attack the server (instantly permanent).</li>
    </ol>
    </li>
    <li><em>Guidelines (not rules):</em><ol>
    <li>Follow the guidelines to assure your experience on this server is enjoyable and snag-free.<ol>
    <li>Don&#39;t assume that any rules outside of the 2.x range are not rules.</li>
    </ol>
    </li>
    <li>Don&#39;t be a dick.</li>
    <li>Be considerate of others in real life, we all want to have fun here. Keep this in mind while building bases/buildings, and keep props to a minimum wherever possible.</li>
    <li>Check the rules often to ensure that you&#39;re up-to-date on any recent changes.<ol>
    <li>You can take advantage of the ruleset name to have a quick idea if the rules have been changed since you&#39;ve last read them. This name is randomly generated each time the rules are changed.</li>
    </ol>
    </li>
    <li>While forums don&#39;t exist for this server, you can take advantage of the steam accounts listed above to dispute bans.</li>
    </ol>
    </li>
    <li><em>Player Behavior:</em><ol>
    <li>Players are NOT allowed to be disrespectful to others (homophobia, racism, etc.) while out of character (OOC).</li>
    <li>Players must have valid rule-based reasons for the start of a demotion vote on another.</li>
    <li>Players may NOT prop climb, unless the use of such props is clearly a feature of their own building/home.</li>
    <li>Players may only kill others for RP reasons, as outlined above.<ol>
    <li>This generally means not senselessly killing others in any situation (raids, robberies, etc.).</li>
    </ol>
    </li>
    <li>Minge-like behavior (being a disruptive asshole) is not allowed and corrective actions are generally up to the discretion of the admins.</li>
    <li>Players&#39; physgun beams must be clearly and easily visible.</li>
    <li>Players may NOT break NLR.<ol>
    <li>NLR, or &quot;New Life Rule&quot; requires players to not return to the area they have died for a short period of time (around 5 minutes), and to sometimes have their character &quot;forget&quot; information about other players (as to not metagame).</li>
    </ol>
    </li>
    <li>Players may NOT metagame.<ol>
    <li>&quot;Metagaming&quot; includes the transfer of in-character information (location of player dwellings, printers, shops, etc.) through out-of-character means (OOC chat and the like).</li>
    </ol>
    </li>
    <li>Players may not constantly raid, kidnap, or mug others. Try to keep a sort of cooldown period of around 5 minutes between these actions. If admins find abuse of these actions, corrective measures may be taken.</li>
    <li>Players must only do criminal actions (raiding, mugging, kidnapping) in relevant jobs. This rule is to help meaningful roleplay between players.<ol>
    <li>The general rule of thumb for this is, if you have a good roleplay reason to do an action, you can do it.</li>
    </ol>
    </li>
    <li>Crimes are <em>NOT</em> required to be advertised! Advertising crimes not only makes your character (and by extension you) look stupid, but can actually get you kicked from failure to read these rules!</li>
    </ol>
    </li>
    <li><em>Raids:</em><ol>
    <li>As required in 3.10, raids may only be performed in appropriate relevant jobs.</li>
    <li>As outlined in 3.11, raids are not required to be advertised.</li>
    <li>As outlined in 3.9, raids may not be carried out too often in too short of a time on the same victim. A cooldown of 5 minutes is suggested, it is up to the admin to judge if a reasonable amount of time has been taken between raiding places.</li>
    </ol>
    </li>
    <li><em>Buildings:</em><ol>
    <li>Players must not build in locations that are <em>both</em> unfair to other players and inappropriate for the builder&#39;s job (criminals building in the police department).</li>
    <li>KOS (Kill On Sight) lines are <em>strictly prohibited</em>.<ol>
    <li>Players may only kill other players that are intruding uninvited into their building, or a building they protect.</li>
    </ol>
    </li>
    <li>Props that can only be seen through from one face (one-way props), may only be placed in pre-existing window areas of the map.</li>
    <li>All window prop fading doors used for shooting through (shooting windows), must always be transparent enough to see players on the other side.</li>
    <li>All modes of attacking intruders of a building must be two-way. For example, a simple window between an attacker and a defender is fine, but a mechanism that abuses bullet ricochets to fire upon intruders is not.</li>
    <li>All enclosed areas of a building must fit two standing players side to side.</li>
    <li>Buildings must not force entering or exiting players to crouch.</li>
    <li>A maximum of two impeding fading doors is allowed for each entrance and exit.</li>
    <li>Players should keep prop counts and other lag-inducing aspects of their build to a minimum in their buildings. Obvious disregard for this rule will result in punitive action.</li>
    </ol>
    </li>
    <li><em>Jobs:</em><ol>
    <li>Citizens Category:<ol>
    <li>Jobs in this category are law abiding, and should not perform any extremely illegal actions (murdering people). Try to keep crimes committed as a job in this category benign.</li>
    <li>Fight Clubs are by default, legal. Mayors may choose to make them illegal, though.</li>
    </ol>
    </li>
    <li>Criminals Category:<ol>
    <li>Jobs in this category are not restricted in type of crimes they may commit.</li>
    </ol>
    </li>
    <li>Dealers Category:<ol>
    <li>Players with jobs in this category absolutely <em>must</em> have a store or place of business.</li>
    <li>Jobs in this category may not raid.</li>
    </ol>
    </li>
    <li>Custom jobs:<ol>
    <li>Players in custom jobs may do criminal actions unless it is extremely inappropriate for the type of character. For example: a custom job named &quot;ISIS&quot; can do criminal actions, but a custom job named &quot;Batman&quot; can&#39;t, because it would be unlike of the character. For custom jobs where it is ambiguous, players may perform criminal actions in that job.</li>
    <li>Players that abuse their privileges may have their custom job taken away from them at any time.</li>
    </ol>
    </li>
    </ol>
    </li>
    <li><em>Rules for Admins:</em><ol>
    <li>Being an administrator doesn&#39;t mean being above the law. Administrators still need to follow the rules of this server, no matter what rank they are in this community.<ol>
    <li>If I player or another administrator finds that an administrator has been acting not within the bounds of these rules, than it should be reported to a higher-up or the owners.</li>
    </ol>
    </li>
    <li>Include the rule that the player broke in any kick/ban/warning messages.<ol>
    <li>A good way to do this is to cite the rule number and title. For example: <code style="font-family: Hack, monospace;">ulx kick MingeMan69 &quot;Breaking rule 3.1 (Disrepect) after a warning was issued&quot;</code></li>
    </ol>
    </li>
    <li>It is strongly recommended, but not required, that all kicks and bans should be signed by the administrator who has assigned them. This is part of an effort to improve transparency to players.</li>
    <li>Abuse of one&#39;s administrative privileges will lead to immediate revocation of such privileges.</li>
    </ol>
    </li>
